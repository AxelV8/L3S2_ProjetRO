# A one-way trip ?
This is one of my last project during my third years of Bachelor's degree . The goal of this project is to ensure that our drones manage to tour the sites 
resources to save us from the planet Mars. This project implements the problem of the commercial traveller in three different ways: 
- Miller-Tucker-Zemlin model. (JuMP)
- Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson model. (JuMP)
- A resolution approached by a Greedy algorithm.
